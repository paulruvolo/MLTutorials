      "Tom Mitchell defines what it means for a computer program to learn in the following way: \u201cA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\u201d\n",
      "\n",
      "This definition highlights a key difference between machine learning and classical statistical methods.  That is, machine learning is chiefly concerned with improving future performance based on prior experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key difference with classical statistical methods is that machine learning focuses on the computational efficiency (in both time and space) of algorithms.  For instance, an active area of machine learning research is to create algorithms that have computational efficiency properties that work with \u201cbig data\u201d.\n",

      "The specific software package we will be using to do machine learning is called [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).  Scikit-learn is a very powerful package that supports a vast array of machine learning algorithms.  To get a sense of the toolkits capabilities check out the [examples page](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html).\n",
